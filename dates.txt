25 jan*St. Pauls Day*This is one of several days on which the superstitious believe the weather can be predicted.|If St. Paul's day be fair and clear, It does betide a happy year; But if it chance to snow or rain, Then will be dear all kind of grain' If clouds or miste do dark the sky, Great store of birds and beasts shall die; And if the winds do flie aloft, Then war shall vexe the kingdom oft. 
2 Feb*Candlemas*Commemorates the presentation of baby Jesus in the Temple, and the purification of the Virgin Mary. Candles are blessed on this day. According to superstition, a sunny Candlemas predicts a cold spring.|If Candlemas Day be fair and bright, Winter will have another flight; But if it be dark with clouds and rain, Winter is gone, and will not come again.|Another superstition is that on this day if a young woman chases the first crow she sees, it would fly in the direction of her future husband, but if the crow should pass a church yard then she would never marry. Observed by Roman Catholic and Anglican churches. Also known as Feast of the Purification of the Virgin. Known in Mexico and Latin America as Dia de la Candelaria. Some of the customs may have originated with the Roman festival of Lupercalia. 
2 feb*Imbolc*"In the Womb." This day was also called Oimelc which means "ewe's milk." The new sheep were born at this time. See also Groundhog Day and Candlemas. Imbolc is described in The Celtic Druids' Year by John King. It was dedicated to the goddess Brigit, who was later transmogrified into the Christian St Brigid or Bridget. The feast took place at the time of the first lambing, and was closely associated with the ewes' coming into milk. In practical terms, it would have marked a vital turning-point in the winter, since the first sheep's milk and cheese would have been of enormous importance with no other fresh foodstuff available and stored meat and grains perhaps beginning to run low. Brigit was an archetype of the great mother-goddess and was the protectress of women in labour and childbirth. Birthwort, the plant analgesic collected and dried in summer, may have been administered by priestesses in her name. This element of worship of the mother-godess and her son survives in the Christian tradition of Candlemas, which is held on 2 February and commemorates the Purification of Our Lady, that is the Virgin Mary, and the Presentation of Christ to the Temple. 
3 Feb*St.Blaize's Day*Traditionaly celebrated with bonfires. The patron saint of sore throat sufferers, wool combers, and waxchandlers. He was believed to have the ability to cure sore throats with prayer. The Feast of Saint Blaise is observed with the blessing of throats. A public holiday in Paraguay.

12 feb*Darwin Day*Darwin Day is a recently instituted celebration intended to commemorate the anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin on February 12, 1809. The day is used to highlight Darwin's contribution to science and to promote science in general.
14 Feb*St.Valentines Day*The legend of Saint Valentine. There is some doubt as to the true identity of Saint Valentine, and in fact it is possible that there were as many of three Valentines. However, the legend is as follows. Emperor Claudius of Rome attempted to abolish marriage because he felt married men did not make good soldiers. Valentine, a priest, then married lovers secretly. The Emperor learned of this and had Valentine imprisoned, where he died on February 14, 271 A.D. This is probably only a popular legend, and the customs more likely pagan. There are acutally two Saint Valentines whose feast day is on February 14. The second was a Bishop of Terni, or possibly Teramo, Italy, who was martyred two or three years later.|Lupercalia. The customs of Valentine's Day may go back to the ancient Roman festival of Lupercalia, which was held annually on February 15 and honored Lupercus, the god of fertility, woodlands, and pastures. The customs of Lupercalia included boys drawing girls' names from a box, which would pair them off as couples for the year. In 494 [496?], Bishop Gelasius replaced Lupercalia with the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin, also known as Candlemas. Old Candlemas Day was celebrated on February 14, but is now observed on the second.|Mating season.. An alternate theory for the origin of the customs is that it is derived from the mating season for birds. It was popularly believed in medieval England and France that at the start of the second fortnight in February that the birds begin to mate. 
15 feb*Lupercalia*An ancient Roman festival held annually in honor Lupercus [aka Faunus], the god of fertility, woodlands, and pastures. Lupercalia is older than Rome itself. The festivities were run by the Luperci, or "Brotherhood of the Wolf". Two male goats and a dog were sacrificed, and the blood of the goats was smeared on the foreheads of two youths with a knife. The knife was then wiped on wool dipped in milk, and the youths were required to laugh. The Luperci, who administered the rites, were crowned, anointed, and wore only an apron of goatskin. Women would line up along the road to receive lashes from the whips to insure fertility. Another custom was to put the names of girls in a box, to be drawn by the boys. Bishop [pope] Gelasius replaced the Lupercalia with the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin in A.D. 494, or Candlemas, which was first observed on February 14 [15?]. Customs of Lupercalia have been carried over into Valentine's Day, Candlemas, Feast of the Nativity and possibly also Carnival. 
15 feb*National Flag of Canada Day*The national flag of Canada was inaugurated on February 15, 1965. The anniversary of this date is officially called the "National Flag of Canada Day", which is often shortened to "Flag Day".
24 feb 1582*Gregorian Calendar Day*On this day in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII established the Gregorian calendar. The Gregorian calendar is a reformed version of the Julian calendar, and is the calendar most commonly used in the world today.
25 feb*Anthestêria (Jar-opening Day)*This is the “Festival of Flowers” when the first shoots of blossom appear, and is one of the oldest Greek festivals, dating back to the second millennium BCE; it was also called the Older Dionysia. At this time the vines are pruned again and the second fermentation of the wine is complete; it is now ready for drinking, and so this festival complements the Oskhophoria (c. Oct. 22), which celebrates the vintage.|1st day: Pithoigia (Jar-opening)|The first day celebrates the opening of the pithoi (jars) in which the wine has fermented. A pompê (procession) symbolizes the coming of Dionysos from the sea in a ship-chariot to His sanctuary; the God may be represented by an image or a masked man. The procession includes musicians and bearers of the ritual instruments, and other men, riding in the carts and perhaps masked as Satyrs, merrily hurl insults at bystanders.|The pithoi are also brought, and after they are broken open and the wine is mixed by the priestesses (i.e. diluted with water, as Dionysos taught the Greeks to drink it), a first-fruits offering is made to Him with a prayer that the wine be beneficial. Then the wine is tasted and there are songs and dances, in which He is celebrated as the Fair-Flowering, the Reveller, the Stormer, etc.
26 feb*Anthestêria (Pitcher Feast)*2nd day: Khoes (Pitcher Feast). On this day all the temples of the gods are closed except the Limnaion, the temple of “Dionysos in the Marshes” (limnais, though there may be no marshes present), which is only open during this festival. Thus the underworld spirits are free to roam and join the feasts of the living. For protection people paint pitch on their doors and chew buckthorn in the morning; business is suspended and no oaths are sworn. Also on this day it is customary that everyone at least three years old drinks wine. (Children are expected to participate because of their connection to fertility.) Everyone, including the children, has their own khoes (pitchers, 2-liter for adults) and drinking cups for wine, often purchased at the festival. The khous has a round body, short neck and trefoil mouth. This is a very child-oriented festival, and a child’s first Khoes is one of the major milestones of life: Birth, Khoes, Puberty and Marriage. He or she is crowned with flowers and might be given a khous, as well as other gifts, such as toys and pets; teachers often invite their pupils to a reception. This is a day for drinking parties, both public and private. Distinguished people are invited by the high priest of Dionysos to a public drinking contest. A trumpet signals the start of the contest, during which no one may speak (for at this time people are cut off from one another as from all other gods but Dionysos). The victory goes to the first to empty his khous, who is awarded a full wineskin. Private contests are similar, but the prize is a cake. Participants bring their own food, cups and khoes, already filled with mixed wine (from the Pithoigia); the host provides the garlands, perfume and dessert. After the contests, they put their garlands around their khoes and proceed to the Limnaion, where they give their garlands to the priestess. There they all thank Dionysos by pouring a libation for Dionysos of the last of the wine from their khoes.
27 feb*Anthestêria (Pot Feast)*3rd day: Khutroi (Pot Feasts). Since the Greeks and Romans reckoned the day from sundown, the last day of the festival begins on the night of the Day of Pitchers. This is the night of the Hieros Gamos (Sacred Marriage) of Dionysos with the Basilinna (Queen), the wife of the Archôn Basileus (Priest King); he must surrender his wife to Dionysos as Theseus, his distant predecessor, surrendered Ariadne to Him.
5 mar*St. Pirins Day*The National Day of Cornwall.The flag of St Piran is also the Cornish flag - white cross on a black background. It symbolises the discovery of tin by the saint as the white metal flowed from the black rock.
4 may*No Pants Day*No Pants Day is a participatory holiday that happens on the first Friday in May. The holiday is based on the premise of having people spend their day not wearing any pants (trousers). Participants are challenged to act as if there is nothing strange about not wearing pants in public. The liberation of breaking a social taboo and seeing the reaction of people not aware of the event generally makes the event fun for its participants.
5 may*Cinco de Mayo*Cinco de Mayo (Spanish for "fifth of May") is a celebration held on 5 May. It is celebrated in the United States and regionally in Mexico, primarily in the state of Puebla, where the holiday is called El Día de la Batalla de Puebla (English: The Day of the Battle of Puebla). The date is observed in the United States as a celebration of Mexican heritage and pride, and to commemorate the cause of freedom and democracy during the first years of the American Civil War. In the state of Puebla, the date is observed to commemorate the Mexican army's unlikely victory over French forces at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862, under the leadership of General Ignacio Zaragoza Seguín. Contrary to widespread popular belief outside of Mexico, Cinco de Mayo is not Mexico's Independence Day—the most important national patriotic holiday in Mexico—which is actually celebrated on September 16
8 may 1945*V-E Day*Commemorates Victory in Europe acheived when the Germans signed an unconditional surrender in 1945, thus ending World War II. In France, Armistice Day is observed on this day.

20 May*World Metrology Day*World Metrology Day celebrates the signature by representatives of seventeen nations of The Metre Convention on 20 May 1875. The Convention set the framework for global collaboration in the science of measurement and in its industrial, commercial and societal application. The original aim of the Metre Convention - the worldwide uniformity of measurement - remains as important today as it was in 1875.
25 May*Towel Day*Towel Day is celebrated every year on the 25 of May as a tribute by fans of the author Douglas Adams.[1] On this day, fans carry a towel with them to demonstrate their appreciation for the books and the author, as referred to in Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The commemoration was first held in 2001, two weeks after Adams' death on 11 May 2001.
20 mar*Persian New Year
15 March*Ides of March*It was on the Ides of March that Julius Caesar was assasinated. The 15th day of March, May, July, or October or the 13th day of the other months in the ancient Roman calendar.
25 Mar*Lady Day*A Christian festival commemorating the announcement by the angel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary of the incarnation of Christ. It was placed in this day in order to be nine months before Chirstmas day. Also known as Lady Day, or Quarter Day in England and Ireland where it is a traditional day to come up with the rent.
1 Apr*April Fools Day*A day on which practical jokes are played on people. Also known as All Fools' Day. In northern England this day is known as April Noddy, and in Scotland as Huntigowok Day. In France, the person fooled is called a poisson d'avril, or "April fish", possibly meaning a young fish that is easily caught. There are various theories about how April Fools' Day originated; the most plausible is that it originated in France. Although the new year began on January 1 during the Roman Era, during the Middle Ages it began to be observed around March 25, being considered the spring equinox as well as Easter. The celebrations lasted for a week, ending with, on April 1, a day of social calls and gift giving. In 1564, Charles IX reestablished January 1 as New Year's Day. Those who were resistant to the change, continued to observe the new year's customs on April 1st, which included exchanging gifts and social visits. These people were then made fun of by others, who sent them mock invitations or mock gifts. It is also possible that April Fools' Day has ancient origins, since there are similar customs throughout the world near the beginning of spring.
22 apr*Earth Day*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day
25 apr*ANZAC Day*A holiday in Australia and New Zealand which honors all who died in wars, and memorializes in particular the troups who were slaughtered at Gallipoli in World War I. ANZAC is an acronym for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. [also observed in Tonga and Western Samoa]
28 apr*Floralia*Until May 3. Roman festival. Predecessor to Pentecost and May Day. It is a celebration of spring that honors Flora, the goddess of flowers and spring. According to legend it was initiated by Romulus in 753 BC, but it more likely began in 238 BC.
23 apr*Vinalia*A Roman festival celebrated by sampling new wine. 
30 Apr*Walpurgis Night*A celebration of spring marked by music, singing and bonfires. The eve of Beltane, an ancient Celtic feast. Early Christians believed witches and evil creatures are supposed to roam this night. Named after St.Walpurgis an English nun, who went on a mission to Germany in the 8th century. This is an old pagan festival, which borrowed its name from Saint Walburga whose feast occurs on May Day. On this night witches are believed to ride on broomsticks and he-goats to places of old pagan sacrifices in the Harz Mountains, especially to Brocken, the highest point in the mountains. It is here in Goethe's Faust that the witches come on Walpurgis Night and sing:|Now to the Brocken the witches ride; The stubble is gold and the corn is green; There is the carnival crew to be seen, And Squire Urianus will come to preside. So over the valleys our company floats, With witches a-farting on stinking old goats.|Witches are driven away on this night with cracking of whips and blasting of horns. Also celebrated in Sweden with bonfires. In Czechoslovakia, people would spread grass or sand on the doorstep in the belief that witches could not enter a house before counting the blades of grass or grains of sand
24 june*Midsummer Day*Midsummer occurs when the days are at their longest in the norther hemisphere, although it misses the actual solstice by a couple days. The celebration of Midsummer is especially popular throughout Europe, with festivities beginning on Midsummer Eve which include lighting bonfires, especially on mountaintops, dancing around and leaping over fires, and other ancient customs. It probably originated in ancient times as sun worship, with the fires representing the power of the sun. These bonfires have been thought to have all sorts of magical properties, from driving away of evil withches and trolls, to ensuring health and affecting the weather. Frazer cites substantial evidence that the fires are actually sun charms. As the sun worship was forgotten, the customs remained and the theme of Midsummer became increasingly romantic. There are a number of customs for predicting one's future spouse. A girl who sees nine Midsummer fires will marry before the end of the year, and placing certain flowers under the pillow will give you dreams of your future mate. In Sweden there are a number of customs on this day similar to customs celebrated elsewhere on May Day, namely dancing around a Maypole and electing a queen for the day. This is also the feast day of Saint John the Baptist, and so is also referred to as Saint John's Day.
5 July*X-Day*X-Day is a traditional part of the Church of the SubGenius, a religion formed as a parody of cults and extreme religious groups, and their pamphlets and claims. X-Day fell on July 5, 1998,[1] the scheduled "end of the world", and has been celebrated on July 5 each year since then. From its inception in 1980, the Church had prophesied that an army of alien invaders (known as the "X-ists" or "Men From Planet X") would land on the planet Earth and destroy the world of "normals", "pinks", and "glorps," while the members of the Church of the SubGenius would be rescued by the aliens and taken away into space.[1][2] Chapters 10 and 11 of Revelation X: The "Bob" Apocryphon supplies additional details as to the precise kinds of fates which supposedly await the "pinks" and "normals" (as well as SubGenii who have not paid their membership fees) left behind when X-Day comes, saying, among other things, that those who are not immediately killed by the aliens will be enslaved by a society of evil clowns known as the "Bozo Cult" until eventually their souls are devoured by the Elder Gods.[3][4] The book also tells readers that if they want more information, they should send one million dollars to Ivan Stang so that he can remake his 1973 film Let's Visit the World of the Future.
20 July 1969*Apollo 11 Moon Landing
25 july*St Christopher's Day*Patron saint of travelers [and in recent times: motorists and bus drivers]. Invokes for protection from perils of water, storms, and plagues. His name means "Christ-bearer", which is what led to the following legend. Christopher carried travelers across a river on his back. One day he was carrying a small child who grew larger and larger until Christopher thought they would both drown. Then the child revealed himself as Jesus and told hime that he had just carried the sins of the whole world on his back. According to legend, anyone who sees a picture of St. Christopher will not die that day. His sainthood was later revoked because it was decided that his actions did not merit his becoming a saint.
1 aug*Lammas*A feast formerly celebrated in England, during which bread from the season's first wheat was consecrated at Mass in thanksgiving for the harvest. Also a feast formerly celebrated in commemoration of Saint Peter's deliverance from prison.
5 aug*International Beer Day*International Beer Day (IBD) is an August 5 celebration founded in 2007 in Santa Cruz, California.[1][2][3] Since its inception, International Beer Day has grown from a small localized event in the western United States into a worldwide celebration spanning 207 cities, 50 countries and 6 continents.[4] Specifically, International Beer Day has three declared purposes:|To gather with friends and enjoy the taste of beer.|To celebrate those responsible for brewing and serving beer.|To unite the world under the banner of beer, by celebrating the beers of all nations together on a single day.
4 sep*Ludi Magni*Ludi Magni begins. In honor of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.
14 aug 1945*V-J Day*Commemerates victory over Japan. On August 14, 1945, President Truman announced that Japan had surrendered to the Allies. The surrender was officially ratified aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on September 2. Truman declared September 2 as Victory-over-Japan Day.
19 sep*International Talk Like a Pirate Day*International Talk Like a Pirate Day (ITLAPD) is a parodic holiday created in 1995 by John Baur (Ol' Chumbucket) and Mark Summers (Cap'n Slappy), of Albany, Oregon,[1] U.S., who proclaimed September 19 each year as the day when everyone in the world should talk like a pirate.[1] For example, an observer of this holiday would greet friends not with "Hello," but with "Ahoy, matey!" The holiday, and its observance, springs from a romanticized view of the Golden Age of Piracy. It has become a holiday for members of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster
5 oct 1930*R101 disaster (1930)
25 oct*St Crispin's Day*Patron saint of shoemakers. Also called Saint Crispin's Day. Nigel Pennick mentions this day in The Pagan Book of Days as follows.|The feast of Saints Crispin and Crispinianus was immortalized by Shakespeare in Henry V, in the king's speech on the eve of the battle of Agincourt, fought on this day in 1415. These twin saints, patrons of shoemakers, are the continuation of the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux, sons of Zeus. 
28 oct*St Simon & St Jude
30 oct*Mischief Night*Mischief Night (also known as Devil's Night, Hell Night, Cabbage Night, Gate Night, Mizzy Night, Miggy Night, Goosing Night, and Egg Nyte) is an annual tradition in parts of the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States when people (primarily teenagers and preteens) take a degree of license to play pranks and do mischief in their neighbourhoods. The most common date for Mischief Night in England and North America is October 30, the day before Halloween
31 oct*Hallowmas Eve*Known as Samhain to the Celts. "Summer's End". The customs are now associated with Halloween. Ancient Celtic Festivals by Clare Walker Leslie and Frank E. Gerace describes the festival of Samhain: The Coligny Calendar referred to this festival as the "Three Nights of Summer's End." There was the last night of the old year, the first night of the new year and the night in between that belonged to no time. Samhain came at an important time in the Celtic year, as people made the transition from summer to winter. They prepared to spend the winter indoors, with stores fo grain, dried meats and fruits, and winter vegetables for themselves, and with grains and hay for their animals. It was a time to decide which animals would be used for next year's breeding and to evaluate the health of the rest of the animals. Only the healthiest animals would be kept alive through the winter. In addition, the warriors had returned from battle so men and women were together again. This was the time for prearranged marriages to begin in earnest as the long winter set in. In much of Western Europe, including France, Spain, and Italy, this eve is observed with masses and prayers at the graves of deceased loved ones. In the United States and Britain this is a night when children get dressed up in costumes of ghosts, witches, and the like, and go trick-or-treating. Since World War II it has been an occaision in the United States to collect for UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, now known as United Nations Children's Fund). The largest celebrations in the United States are in Sanata Barbara, California, and New Orleans, Louisiana.|This trick-or-treating celebrations of this day are associated with All Hallows Eve in name only. Long before the establishment of All Saints' Day, this night was celebrated by the Druids as the eve of Samhain, the New Year of the Druids, when the Lord of Death called together the souls of the wicked who had died during the past year. When the Romans occupied Britain, they brought with them the festival in honor of Pomona, goddess of fruit. This added to the harvest theme of this day. Halloween is on the eve of All Saint's Day, which was moved in the eighth century from May to November, probably to replace the Druid celebration Samhain. The customs of wearing costumes and masks, dancing, and lighting bonfires were believed to frighten away evil spirits, ghosts, witches, goblins, and the Devil. The widespread observance of these Halloween customs came to the Unites States with the massive Irish immigration of the 1840s during the Irish Potato Famine. The customs as they were observed in Scotland in 1785 have been captured in Robert Burns' poem Halloween. Customs of Halloween The original jack-o'-lanterns of the Irish were made out of turnips, rutabagas, and potatoes, not pumpkins. In The American Book of Days, Jane M. Hatch relates the following story about the origins of the jack-o'-lantern.|The name jack-o'-lantern supposedly came from an Irish tale of a man named Jack who was notorious for durnkenness and for being stingy. One evening at the local pub, the Devil appeared to claim his soul. Jack skillfully persuaded the Devil to "have one drink together before we go." To pay for his drink, the Devil turned himself into a sixpence, which Jack immediately snatched. He put it into his wallet, which had a catch in the form of a cross, thus preventing the Devil from escaping. Jack eventualy released the Devil on condition that the latter leave him in peace for another year. Twelve months later, Jack played another practical joke on the Devil, letting him down from a tree only on the promise that he would never pursue him again. Finally, Jack's body wore out. Barred from heaven because of transgressions and from Hell because of the pranks he played on the Devil, Jack in desperation begged the Devil for a live coal to light his way out of the dark. Jack put it into a turnip he was chewing and, as the story goes, is condemned to walk the earth with his lantern until Judgment Day. 
1 Nov*All Saint's Day*A Christian holiday observed in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Commemorates all the saints and martyrs who do not have dedicated special days. Obligitory for Roman Catholics. Also known as All Hallows Day.
2 Nov*All Souls' Day*A Christian day dedicated to all departed souls of the faithful, especially those in purgatory. This day was instituted by Saint Odilo, abbot of Cluny, France (d.1048) who ordered it to be observed throughout the Cluniac monasteries. It spread through the rest of Christendom by the end of the thirteenth century. The origins are linked to an ancient festival of the dead. In Europe it is believed that on this night the dead visit their homes and eat the food of the living. Candles are left burning and "soulcakes" are left out. In Britain, on the eve of this night "soulers" would once go from house to house saying prayers for the dead and asking for soulcakes. It was believed that the more cakes you could eat, the more souls you could save from purgatory. Also known as Day of the Dead, especially in Mexico, where families picnic at the graves of their dead relatives, and give the children toys, bread and sweets in the shapes of skeletons or caskets. The pagan origins of this holiday are mentioned in The Pagan Book of Days by Nigel Pennick. All Souls' Day commemorates departed spirits not elevated to sainthood. Before becoming a church festival in 998 C.E., it was marked with celebrations from the festival of Woden (Odin) as god of the dead: parading the Hodening wild horse and other guising including mummers' plays enacting the mysteries of life, death, and rebirth. Ceremonial soulcakes were cooked and eaten on this day.
13 Nov*World Kindness Day

It honored Saturnus, the god of agriculture. Observance included exchanging presents and offering sacrifices.

Many Christian customs are derived from this festival.

31 dec*New Year's Eve*Celebrated with partying, new year's resolutions, and the singing of the Robert Burns song, Auld Lange Syne. | |Should auld acquaintance be forgot, |And never brought to mind? |Should auld acquaintance be forgot, |And auld lang syne! | |Chorus. |For auld lang syne, my dear, |For auld lang syne. |We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet, |For auld lang syne. | |And surely ye'll be your pint stowp! |And surely I'll be mine! |And we'll tak a cup o' kindness yet, |For auld lang syne. -Chorus. | |We twa hae run about the braes, |And pou'd the gowans fine; |But we've wander'd mony a wary fit, |Sin' auld lang syne. -Chorus. | |We twa hae paidl'd in the burn, |Frae mornign sun till dine; |But seas between us braid hae roar'd |Sin' auld lang syne. -Chorus. | |And there's a hand, my trusty fere! |And gie's a hand o' thine! |And we'll tak a right gude-willie waught, |For auld lang syne. -Chorus.
1 Jan*New Year's Day*January is the first month of the year according to the Gregorian calendar, which is used in almost all the world today.  The month is named for Janus, a Roman god.  According to Roman legend, the ruler Numa Pompilius added January and February to the end of the 10-month Roman calendar in about 700 B.C. He gave the month 30 days.  Later, the Romans made January the first month of the year.  In 46 B.C., the Roman statesman Julius Caesar added a day to January, making it 31 days long.  The Anglo-Saxons called the first month Wolfmonth because wolves came into the villages in winter in search of food.
11 Nov 1918*Armistice Day (1918)*Commemorates the anniversary of the end of World War I, which occurred on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day in the eleventh month in 1918. The war ended when the Allies and the Germans signed the Armistice. It is a public holiday in several countries. There are a couple similar holidays also occuring on the anniversary of this event. Remembrance Day also commemorates the end of World War II and is a public holiday in Canada, and in Bermuda, where it also honors the dead of these wars with military parades and memorial ceremonies. Veteran's Day honors the members of the armed forces of both World Wars, Korea, and Vietnam, and is a public holiday in the United States. 
25 Dec*Christmas Day*The pagan festival of sol invictus (unconquered sun). Christmas is more a day honoring the birth of Christ than it is a birthday celebration on the precise date, as the real birthday of Christ is unknown. December is the rainy season in Judea, and a time when shepherds would not have been in the fields of Bethlehem. Even the year is not certain, and could not have been later than 4 B.C, the year of King Herod's death. Furthermore, the early Christians did not celebrate birthdays, and the celebration of Christ's birth is not as religiously significant as his ressurection, celebrated with Easter. It is most likely that the observance of Christmas was established to replace existing pagan festivals of the time. Pagan festivals celebrating the winter solstice were common in pre-Christian times, the most significant at the time being the Roman Saturnalia, and the Mithraic birthday of the unconquered sun. Much of our current Christmas lore comes from these ancient customs. Saint Nicholas inherited his reindeer from the Nordic god Odin, chief of the wild hunt, who rode with them through the sky.|Saturnalia. This ancient Roman festival occuring December 17 to 23 was the predecessor to many of the customs of Christmas. The festival of Saturn celebrated in ancient Rome, at the end of the vintage and harvesting, with feasting and unrestrained merrymaking. It honored Saturnus, the god of agriculture. Observance included exchanging presents and offering sacrifices. Masters served their slaves as a token of the equality of rank and the lack of class distinctions during the golden age (which was supposedly ruled over by Saturnus). Gifts were exchanged, most commonly wax tapers and clay dolls which were primarily given to children.|Mithra. Mithraism was Christianity's main competitor for converts in early Chrisitan times. Mithraic winter festival celebrating the birthday of Mithra, the god of the Sun, Coincides with a pagan celebration of the winter solstice -- "birthday of the unconquered sun".|Early Celebrations. Christmas did not appear until the 4th century, and its establishment was preceded by Easter, Pentecost, Ascension, and Epiphany. Celebrated in Rome from beginning about 330 A.D., but even then probably not widespread. It was mentioned by Clemens Alexadrinus around this time. Original date was January 6 in the Eastern churches as part of the Epiphany observance, but this was replaced with December 25 in the 5th century.|Just as the date of Christmas was due to pagan festivals, many of the Christmas customs we celebrate today have ancient origins, not only from the Roman Saturnalia, but from the Druids, Teutons, and others, who had their own winter celebrations. Nordic [Teutonic] Juul, etc. Some of the customs, i.e. christmas carols, may have come from the Lord of Misrule celebration. |Mistletoe. The hanging of mistletoe comes from the Druids, to whom it was believed to have healing powers. They would hang it over their doors to appease the woodland spirits, in the belief that only happiness could pass the mistletoe. From this is derived the custom to kiss under the mistletoe at Christmas time. Holly The use of holly to "deck the halls" most likely either comes from Saturnalia or from the Teutonic tradition of hanging evergreens in homes as a refuge for sylvan spirits from the inclement winter weather.|Gifts. There had long been a custom of exchanging gifts on New Year's Day [romans?]. Because of the pagan origins of this custom, and the desire by the Christians to abolish all pagan customs combined with the difficulty in eliminating long observed customs, the gift-giving custom was moved to Christmas, where it could be looked upon as an emulation of the Magi, and a token of generosity and goodwill.|Santa Claus. The name is a corruption of Saint Nicholas (Sinter Klaas), the patron saint of children, whose feast day is on December 6. It was the custom in old England to clean out the chimney at the beginning of the year so that luck could descend and stay all year. This may have been the origin for Santa Claus' habit of entering through the chimney.|Christmas tree. Only legends. The Christmas tree was originally a German tradition. Although perhaps not completely unknown in England, did not become standard until Queen Victoria married the German Prince Albert. In 1870, the German Army celebrated Christmas in Notre Dame, thereby introducing the custom to France [franco-prussian war?]. The custom was brought to America by German immigrants. 
26 Dec*Boxing Day*It takes its name from the custom of sending Christmas boxes to errand boys, porters, servants, mail carriers, and others entitled to small gifts at this time. A legal holiday in Great Britain and most of western Europe, Canada, Australia, and many of the former possessions of the British Empire. In Ireland it is celebrated as Saint Stephen's Day and in Italy as Santo Stefano. In the United Kingdom it is observed on the following Monday.

25 Jan*Burns Night*Aka Burns Supper. After Robert Burns (1759-1796). Scottish poet considered the major poetic voice of his nation. His lyrics, written in dialect and infused with humor, celebrate love, patriotism, and rustic life. Burns was born on January 25 1759, in Alloway, Ayrshire in south-west Scotland. He is renowned worldwide as a great poet and songwriter. A keen social commentator, Burns wrote movingly about love, universal brotherhood and the human condition. He wrote from the heart and, to this day, his words are considered timeless. The Burns Night supper ritual was started by close friends of the poet a few years after his death (in 1796) as a tribute to his memory. The basic format for the evening still follows the same pattern whether it is held in formal dining rooms or the local pub. The ceremony begins when the designated "chairman" of the evening invites "the company" (guests) to receive the haggis - a traditional Scottish dish made of minced offal with suet, onions, oatmeal and seasonings.
27 Jan 2001*WWII Genocide Memorial Day
1 Mar*St.David's Day*Saint David, or "Dewi Sant" in Welsh, is the patron saint of Wales. He is credited with converting Wales to Christianity. This holiday also commemorates King Caswallon's victory on this day in 640 AD.
17 Mar*St.Patrick's Day*Holiday in N. Ireland, Newfoundland. Patron saint of Ireland. He was born in Britain and was captured by Celts and taken to Ireland as a slave. When fifteen, he escaped and made his way back to Britain. Later he became trained as a monk, and returned to Ireland. Mainly thanks to Patrick's influence, Ireland had an age of literacy while the rest of Europe plummeted into the Dark Ages. Honors the patron saint of Ireland by commemorating his death. It is the national holiday of the Republic of Ireland (Eire). The custom is that one must wear green on this day or get pinched. New York has celebrated it with a parade since 1762. It is observed in Rome with religious services.
23 Apr*St.George's Day*Adopted by Edward III as the patron saint of England. Holiday in Newfoundland. Celebrated in England and New Zealand. In Greece it is celebrated in the towns of Lemnos, Arahova, Assi, Gonia, and Cos. In eastern Europe St. George's Day is observed with ancient fertility customs. A South Slavonian woman desiring to have a child puts a new chemise on a fruitful tree on the previous evening, and examines the garment before the sun rises on St. George's Day. If a living creature has crawled in to it, superstition says she will have a baby within the year. In the Ukraine, a priets blesses the newly sprouting crops, after which young married couples roll over the soil to promote the growth of the crops. Patron saint of chivalry, England, Canada, Portugal, Germany, Genoa, and Venice. According to legend, George passed through the town of Sylene in Libya, which he found to be terrorized by a dragon. The townsfolk had been appeasing the dragon by choosing a sacrificial victim by lot. On this day it was the king's daughter who was chosen. She was dressed as a bride and chained to a rock to be given to the dragon, but the valiant George conquered the dragon and brought it back to town. He said he would slay it on condition that they convert to Christianity, and as a result fifteen thousand were baptised. 
1 may*May Day (Beltane)*The Celtic feast of Beltane "The Fires of Bel." This celebration marks the beginning of the warm half of the year, and the time to plant crops and send sheep and cattle to the pastures. To celebrate they would dance around a tree while weaving ribbons around it. This is still the best known ceremony of May Day. May Day is an ancient celebration of the coming of spring, which typically begins with bonfires the previous evening on Walpurgis Night. The traditional May Day customs are especially observed in the British Isles and Scandinavia, where it is customary to set up a Maypole and dance around it by weaving ribbons in and out around the pole. The puritan Phillip Stubbes colourfully describes May Day with disgust: Against May, Whitsonday, or other time, all the yung men and maides, olde men and wives, run gadding over night to the woods, groves, hils, and mountains, where they spend all the night in plesant pastimes; and in the morning they return, bringing with them birch and branches of trees, to deck their assemblies withall. And no mervaile, for there is a great Lord present amongst them, as superintendent and Lord over their pastimes and sportes, namely, Sathan, prince of hel. But the chiefest jewel they bring from thence is their May-pole, which they bring home with great veneration, as thus. They have twentie or fortie yoke of oxen, every oxe having a sweet nose-gay of flouers placed on the tip of his hornes, and these oxen drawe home this May-pole, which they bring home this May-pole (this stinkyng ydol, rather), which is covered all over with floures and hearbs, bound round about with strings, from the top to the bottome, and sometime painted with variable colours, with two or three hundred men, women and children following it with great devotion. And thus beeing reared up, with handkercheefs and flags hovering on the top, they straw the ground rounde about, binde green boughes about it, set up sommer haules, bowers, and arbors hard by it. And then fall they to daunce about it, like as the heathen people did at the dedication of the Idols, whereof this is a perfect pattern, or rather the thing itself. I have heard it credibly reported (and that viva voce) by men of great gravitie and reputation, that of fortie, threescore, or a hundred maides going to the wood over night, there have scaresly the third part of them returned home againe undefiled.|The licentious antics that were often a part of these celebrations so offended the Puritans, that they managed to outlaw Maypoles in 1644. In 1661, Charles II ended these restrictions and built London's tallest ever Maypole (134') which later became the support for Sir Isaac Newton's telescope. The Puritans were more successful in the New World in supressing this holiday. In 1628 Governor William Bradford wrote: |They allso set up a May-pole, drinking and dancing about it many days together, inviting the Indean women for their consorts, dancing and frisking together.|He goes on to tell how the Puritan leader John Indecott had the Maypole cut down and put an end to the fun. These customs originated with the Beltaine festival of the Druids, and with the ancient Roman festival of Floralia. In modern times it has come to symbolize labor, and is accompanied by parades. 
24 May*Empire Day*Occurs on the date of Queen Victoria's birthday. It was originally called The Queen's Birthday and is also known as Victoria Day, but has come to celebrate the unity of the Empire rather than to commemorate the Queen.
29 May*Oak Apple Day*Birthday of Charles II, also the day (1660) he landed at the Restoration. It commemorates his escape fram the battle of Worcester by hiding in the Boscobel oak, 1651.

12 July*Battle of the Boyne Day*Holiday in Northern Ireland
15 Jul*St.Swithin's Day*Bishop of Winchester from 852 to 862. According to an ancient legend, St Swithin asked to be buried "where the rain would fall." As his relics were about to be moved on this day in 904, it began to rain heavily and continued for forty days. The legend has it that the weather on this day will forcast the weather for the next forty days, as passed down in the following verse: Saint Swithin's day if thou dost rain, for forty days it will remain; Saint Swithin's day if thou be fair, For forty days 'twill rain na mair. It is believed that this day represents a Christianization of a pagan day of augury.

5 Nov*Guy Fawkes Night*The Gunpowder plot was a conspiracy by a band of desparate Roman Catholics in the reign of James I to avenge the harsh treatment to which Catholics were subjected. Memorializes the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605 in which Guy Fawkes and others attempted to blow up the King and Parliament. At the time Catholics who refused to attend services of the Church of England (recusants) were considered traitors and persecuted. When James I accended the throne the Catholics were hopeful, for he had promised not to collect the fines against the recusants, but instead of keeping his promises he continued to execute the severe laws against them. Fawkes, who was Roman Catholic, joined with veteran conspritors Robert Catesby and others in a plot to blow up the whole Parliament, king and lords included. A vault directly under the House of Lords was conveniently for rent, and Fawkes took it. They filled it with 36 barrels of gunpowder and waited for parliament to meet, which was delayed several times and finally set to be November 5th. In the mean time disagreements broke out among the conspirators because the Catholic lords and members of parliament would be killed in addition to the king and other intended victims. Ten days before Parliament opened, a Catholic lord who was friend to several of the conspiritors received an anonymous tip not to attend, for "they shall receyve a terrible blowe this parleament". He relayed his message to the king. Despite warnings that all was found out, Fawkes remained determined to see the plot through, but was discovered on the day of the planned plot. To reveal the names of his partners, Fawkes was tortured in accordance with the King's letter which said, "If he will not otherwise confess, the gentlest tortures are to be first used to him, and so on, step by step, to the most severe, and so God speed the good work." All the conspirators were hanged if not killed in the act of being taken, and the laws against recusants were made more severe. The fifth of November was ordered to be a day of Thankgiving by an Act that lasted over two hundred years. The eve of this day is known in some areas of England as Mischief Night, and is a night that young people make pranks. Nigel Pennick writes in The Pagan Book of Days about the custom of burning an effigy of Guy Fawkes on this night.|Guy Fawkes Night, celebrated by the burning in effigy of a would-be regicide, continues the earlier tradition of burning effigies of the evil spirits of the past old year. By cremating them, along with outworn hurts and grievances, the new year may be faced in a purer way, free of unnecessary and unhelpful psychic leftovers. 
9 nov*Lord Mayor's Day*The annual installation of the Lord Mayor of the City of London. The Lord Mayor is elected on Michaelmas, September 29, by the aldermen sworn into office on November 8, and installed on the following day. The celebration includes a procession of the Lord Mayor and his retinue from the Guild Hall to the Law Courts, andlater to Westminster.

2 Feb*Groundhog Day (USA)*Used to forcast the weather. According to superstition, when the ground hog emerges from his winter burrow on this day, if he sees his shadow, he returns, and the winter will last for six more weeks. If he does not see his shadow, i.e. the day is cloudy, then he remains outside in anticipation of an early spring. This legend is probably an American version of the ancient belief that a sunny Candlemas (also February 2) predicts a cold spring. Other days with weather superstitions include Saint Swithin's Day
